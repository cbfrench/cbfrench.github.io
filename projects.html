            <h3>Allsafe Self Storage</h3>
            <h4>Last Updated: 02/03/2018</h4>
            <p>Allsafe Self Storage is the first website that I built completely. The website, last updated in 2006, was rebuilt in 2014 and introduced me to the challenges of satisfying the client. This site was an exercise in compromise, as the client enjoyed their old site but were steadily losing business due to the out-of-date appearance and functions.</p>

            <h3>Smash 5 Speculation</h3>
            <h4>Last Updated: 03/25/2018</h4>
            <p>After it was revealed that Super Smash Bros. was going to be released for the Nintendo Switch on March 8th, I spent as much of my free time as possible creating a site to contain my speculation and official announcements for the game. As it is the newest of my projects, it is very much still under development.</p>

            <h3>Smash Character Helper</h3>
            <h4>Last Updated: 04/10/2017</h4>
            <p>This site is more of a pet project of mine. Built in the summer of 2016, the purpose of this project was to help my roommates choose a character in a popular video game. This project also served to re-educate me on my JavaScript knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Sleep-Aid</h3>
            <h4>Last Updated: 11/22/2017</h4>
            <p>Sleep-Aid is the first site that I constructed for which I still has a working version of the code. The purpose of this site is to provide a soothing screen and sounds to help the viewer to fall asleep. I often have trouble sleeping, so this meant a lot to me when completed.</p>

            <h3>Surfers of Tomorrow</h3>
            <h4>Last Updated: 11/16/2017</h4>
            <p>Surfers of Tomorrow is the first site I built for my current job. This site introduced me to the difficulties that could occur during staging and gave me the idea for this site's current theme.</p>

            <p>Pong is what happens when I can't sleep at night and need a fun project to do. This one is currently still in development.</p>
