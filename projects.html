            <h3>Allsafe Self Storage</h3>
            <p>Allsafe Self Storage is the first website that I built completely. The website, last updated in 2006, was rebuilt in 2014 and introduced me to the challenges of satisfying the client. This site was an exercise in compromise, as the client enjoyed their old site but were steadily losing business due to the out-of-date appearance and functions.</p>

            <h3>Smash Character Helper</h3>
            <p>This site is more of a pet project of mine. Built in the summer of 2016, the purpose of this project was to help my roommates choose a character in a popular video game. This project also served to re-educate me on my JavaScript knowledge.</p>

            <h3>Sleep-Aid</h3>
            <p>Sleep-Aid is the first site that I constructed for which I still has a working version of the code. The purpose of this site is to provide a soothing screen and sounds to help the viewer to fall asleep. I often have trouble sleeping, so this meant a lot to me when completed.</p>
