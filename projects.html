            <h1>Allsafe Self Storage</h1>
            <p>Allsafe Self Storage is the first website that Connor French built completely. The website, last updated in 2006, was rebuilt in 2014 and introduced Connor to the challenges of satisfying the client. This site was an exercise in compromise, as the client enjoyed their old site but were steadily losing business due to the out-of-date appearence and functions.</p>

            <h1>Smash Character Helper</h1>
            <p>This site is more of a pet project for Connor. Built in the summer of 2016, the purpose of this project was to help his roommates choose a character in a popular video game. This project also served to re-educate Connor on his JavaScript knowledge.</p>

            <h1>SleepAid</h1>
            <p>SleepAid is the first site that Connor constructed for which he still has a working version of the code. The purpose of this site is to provide a soothing screen and sounds to help the viewer to fall asleep. Connor often had trouble sleeping, so this meant a lot to him when completed.</p>
