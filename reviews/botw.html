                    <p><game>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</game> is the most recent entry in the <game>Zelda</game> series. In it, you play as Link, a knight of the princess Zelda who has been asleep for 100 years after suffering a defeat at the hands of Calamity Ganon, who is currently being prevented from destroying the world by the princess.</p>

                    <p><game>Breath of the Wild</game> was the first game to be released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and the last game for the Wii U, so it had to look good enough to be both the triumphant birth of a new system and a swan song of a dying one. And boy, did it deliver. The game uses cel-shaded graphics to marvelous effect, creating a game world that is beautiful in its design and just makes you want to say “Wow.” The game looks absolutely stunning and vibrant; everything fits in the environment and makes Hyrule feel like a truly cohesive place.</p>
                    <p>The menu systems bring further attention to the beauty and serenity of the game world by being as minimalistic and unobtrusive as possible. There is no menu music, no annoying menu animations, and no bright colors to distract from the gameplay, showing that the beauty of the game is what is truly important.</p>
                    <p>Another aspect of the game’s beautiful presentation is the score. The music when your’e just out exploring is very minimal, allowing the sounds of the nature in the game to take over. The soundtrack really makes the player feel like they are experiencing something serene and pure and expresses the beauty of nature. However, when nature decides to attack you, the music changes to an upbeat track warning you of danger. This song does an excellent job of increasing tension in the player and making them feel like they’re truly in danger. The other song that is extremely noticeable is the one that plays near each of the three dragons that call Hyrule home. This one is a variation on the main theme of the game that truly leaves the player feeling awe-inspired at the sight of something marvelous.</p>

                    <p>Speaking of a marvelous sight, this game is absolutely gorgeous. It uses a cel-shaded style of rendering to be able to show the game in 720p in handheld mode and 900p in docked mode. This is pretty good for the first game on the console, as few have had experience optimizing for the system yet, but it could have still been better. The cel-shaded graphics make up for this by making the game appear very smooth in general. The game runs at a fairly stable 30fps for the most part, allowing for a cinematic feel to most of the gameplay. However, the game does falter in areas with lots of particle effects, like fire or smoke, and in areas with lots of vegetation. This is not too much of a problem, as the frame drops are relatively infrequent, but it is extremely noticeable in one area that takes away from the experience slightly: finding the Master Sword. The Master Sword is in a plinth in the middle of an area covered with fog and surrounded by vegetation, which is a stunning image but causes the game to drop to somewhere around 20fps. While not the biggest issue, it is kind of a bummer that finding the sword is not as epic as it could be.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>The gameplay, however, is quite consistently amazing. The game just drops you in an amazing world with all of the freedom to explore and fight and collect materials and do just about whatever you set your mind to. Ever wanted to kill an enemy with a giant boulder? Or travel across the map on a log? Or jump off a cliff from a horse and glide over the ocean? Now you can! The game offers so much freedom of choice that it could be seen as a hinderance to players that need to be directed where to go, but the game still offers direction to those players via map markers. The player can choose to play however they want; they can explore the world for ages and follow along with the story, or they can make a mad dash for Hyrule Castle to defeat Ganon as soon as they get off the Great Plateau tutorial section. It’s frankly amazing that the developers were able to make the story of <game>Breath of the Wild</game> lend itself to this flexibility in gameplay styles.</p>
                    <p>Of course, some people will say that in order to allow for the amount of choice the player has, the story must not be made overly important so that players who opt to go straight for the castle aren’t missing much. This is true to a point, as the story consists almost entirely of flashbacks to the Calamity that struck 100 years prior. However, the austerity of the story lends itself well to the game itself, providing a minimalistic look at an idea that the designers have beautifully expressed. The story makes the player feel loss, as Link has already tried to quell Ganon 100 years ago and had failed, even with the help of the four Champions and Zelda. This disastrous attempt led to the death of the Champions, the slumber of Link, and Zelda being forced to use her power to hold Ganon at bay for a century after he laid waste to most of the country. The world shows details of this tragedy, from ruined cities and forts to statues in honor of the fallen Champions, and it really ties the story in with the world around you and makes the player really feel the heightened stakes when facing Ganon the second time around.</p>
                    <p>Of course, you cannot hope to defeat Ganon without mastering the combat mechanics, but that shouldn’t be a problem as the combat system is incredibly fluid and easy to manage. You can lock onto an enemy by holding a button and attack in close range with swords, spears, axes, and a variety of other weapons, as well as shield to protect from attacks or use your bow to strike from long range. Locking on is excellent, as it allows you to perform other actions to gain the edge over your opponent, like parrying their attack or jumping to the side or flipping backwards. If any of these are executed with the correct timing, the enemy is left wide open for a time while you get to perform a slow-motion finisher that is both extremely satisfying to pull off and incredibly damaging to your opponents. Also satisfying are the bow and arrow mechanics, as they allow Link to excel at long range combat. Link has access to six different kinds of arrows that each have different effects, like burning or shocking enemies, and the aiming mechanics allow Link to get the most out of each of them. Large movements of the bow can be executed via the control stick, but the game utilizes the motion controls of the Switch hardware for the finer movements, allowing shots to be just as precise as if you were using a mouse and keyboard without the drawback of being forced to use one for the rest of the game. You also have the ability to slow down time in midair if the bow is pulled out, allowing you to destroy your enemies in style. Also, each weapon this time around has a durability, meaning that using a weapon too much can cause the weapon to break. This forces the player to be more careful about the weapon they choose, as they may want to save stronger ones for later. While this system works as intended in making the player be careful, the weapons break slightly too frequently for my liking, and if you have a favorite weapon, eventually it will break and be lost to you. The Master Sword partially remedies this by being unbreakable, but it will run out of energy every so often and you have to wait for it to recharge. While it is perfectly understandable why it has to still recharge (otherwise you would never use anything else), it’s kind of disappointing to have to switch to a less than optimal weapon to deal with the enemy because the sword loses power. Even with this somewhat minor flaw, the combat system is still great and destroying enemies in <game>Zelda</game> is more fun than ever.</p>
                    <p>The enemies that you’ll be destroying are quite good as well. Each class of enemy has varying difficulty levels that you can determine through their skin patterns and colorations, and some enemies have elemental variations as well that can be defeated with more ease if you use the correct elemental counterpart. For instance, ice Lizals can be defeated with one shot of a flame arrow, which allows for more creativity on the part of the player to defeat them. Some enemies, like the Guardian and the Lynel, are downright terrifying at times because they are merciless and can steamroll you if you’re not prepared. However, some of the enemies are just kind of annoying, like the flocks of Keese that will consistently harass you until you either outrun them or shoot enough arrows into their ranks. This would be perfectly fine if not for the fact that this game does not have too much in the way of enemy variety; there aren’t enough different types of enemies to make the annoying ones rare enough to encounter, meaning you’ll be avoiding them as best you can a few too many times.</p>
                    <p>However, in being forced to deal with these enemies that don’t really pose a threat, the player is given the opportunity to mess around with the runes stored in the Sheikah Slate, and they are a blast. The two different types of remote bombs allow for so many different options, like rolling one into a group of enemies or placing one on the ground, waiting until the enemy picks it up, and then detonating it. The Magnesis rune also lets you mess with enemies in addition to its intended purpose of being able to find and move magnetic objects however you wish. In the early game, I was forced to fight an enemy a few times without a stable weapon, but that didn’t matter when I could just levitate a metal box over their heads and drop it on them. Stasis allows the player to freeze one object at a time, and it doesn’t even have to be inanimate, so Link can just freeze his enemies in place and swing his weapon to his heart’s content. Speaking of freezing, the Cryonis rune allows Link to freeze water and create a pillar of it extending from the surface, allowing him to reach water-locked places or shield himself from aquatic-based attacks. Other than that, the only other rune is the Camera, which is a cute addition that allows Link to take photos of the world and posed selfies alike. Overall, each one of them adds something unique and exciting to the gameplay.</p>
                    <p>Link has other powers besides the runes; he receives a power from each of the Champion’s spirits once he conquers each of their respective Divine Beasts. Each of these powers helps Link in a different aspect of his adventure: Revali’s Gale allows Link to shoot upward in the air, allowing him to climb to new heights. Mipha’s Grace allows Link to regenerate to full health once if he is killed, Daruk’s Protection gives link a free shield and counterattack, and Urbosa’s Fury gives Link a powerful lightning strike when he performs a strong spinning attack. Each of these abilities allow Link to patch up one of his weaknesses to make the player stronger, but not too strong, as each requires significant recharge time before being used again. All of them add something to the game, especially Revali’s Gale, which allows Link to explore even more than he could previously.</p>
                    <p>Exploring is precisely how Link acquires his new Championship abilities, as well as increased stamina and health. The abilities are gathered by defeating the Divine Beasts, which involve climbing inside, solving puzzles to activate terminals, and defeating the boss at the end. They function as standard <game>Zelda</game> dungeons in this manner, which caused many people to state that they were upset that the dungeons did not have more aesthetic variety. However, the similarity further emphasizes the Sheikah design that was used thousands of years prior when they were crafted, which only serves to further immerse the player in the world. Sheikah designs can be found all over the world, but especially in the 120 shrines that are littered across the map. Each one has a puzzle or enemy inside for you to defeat, or simply finding the shrine itself is the puzzle. Once a shrine is found, it can be used as a waypoint for the fast travel system used in the game, incentivizing the player to find more for more efficient traveling. Also to incentivize the player to find the shrines is the fact that finding four shrines will allow you to upgrade your health or your stamina by one level, either making the combat easier or aiding in exploration. This system of shrines, combined with the four Divine Beasts, creates an engaging series of puzzles that fit perfectly into the vision Nintendo had for this world.</p>

Even though the game is not perfect, it is so amazingly beautiful and outrageously thrilling that it might as well be.
