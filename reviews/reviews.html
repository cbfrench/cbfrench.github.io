        <h1>Reviews</h1>
        <h3>Games</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Never review a game you have not played</li>
            <li>Try to only review games that you have completed</li>
            <li>Review different game genres each time to keep your objectivity</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ordering</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always begin with objective facts, then end with opinions</li>
            <li>Begin with presentation, as that's the first thing people see</li>
            <li>Make sure to mention seemingly pointless details, like music and menu design, as well as the important things like controls and gameplay</li>
            <li>End on gameplay, and devote most of the review to it unless something else deserves more mention</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scale</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a unique scale if you want to appear consistent</li>
            <li>Using a decimal-base scale is the most pleasing, but can lead to score padding and angry fans</li>
        </ul>
