                    <p>As many reviewers do, I've attached a numerical number to the end of my review. I do my best to try to be as objective as possible, but at the end of the day, the review is all about my opinion. Below is my opinion of how games should be ranked, as I find the current method of giving every game above a 7 not beneficial to anyone. I've balanced the ranking below and you can check to see the qualifications for each ranking tier. As I'm trying to simplify things, I will not use decimals in my reviews, so what you see is what you get.</p>

                    <p>A game that is outstanding in nearly every area. It is not perfect, as nothing ever is, but the enjoyment gained from it and the sheer craftsmanship of the game itself make it impossible to be ignored and should be played by everyone.</p>
