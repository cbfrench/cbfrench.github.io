                    <p><game>Shovel Knight</game> originally came out in 2014 for the Wii U to resounding praise from the Nintendo community. It was ported to several other consoles, and it finally made its way to the Nintendo Switch, becoming a fantastic portable experience in the process.</p>

                    <p>It is easy to see why this game was ported to multiple consoles, as the 8-bit art style is just a joy to look at. The level and character designs harken back to an era filled with 2D platformers made with love, which <game>Shovel Knight</game> clearly is. This love is even more evident in all of the sounds you can hear in the game as well as the soundtrack, as each one evokes the older style of generated sounds while still bringing something new to the table. The sprites are all beautifully made and the animations are fluid and wonderful for the titular knight, as well as the various enemies and bosses littered throughout the game. The design of the menus and especially the screen also add to the idea that you’re playing a game from an older era, with elements like the solid black bars at the top and bottom of the screen and the gradual screen transitions. Each one of these details make this game feel like a true homage to older games that you might find on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>

                    <p>However, this game does not run like one of those older games. The game runs at a smooth 60fps without ever dropping graphical fidelity, which is in part due to the 2D art style, which just looks beautiful all around.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>Beautiful all around can also be said of the rest of the game itself. <game>Shovel Knight</game> is a game in the Metroidvania genre that takes a lot of elements from both of the namesakes of the genre. It features the Shovel Knight, a a knight with a shovel, who must rescue Shield Knight, a knight with a shield, and the rest of the kingdom from the Enchantress and the Order of No Quarter. This setup, though generic and common within the genre, is heartwarming and charming due to the amount of love poured into it. The Order of No Quarter is just a clever name, and each of their members are cleverly designed and are each a challenge to defeat. While they can be a bit too challenging at times, the game never makes them feel unfair; rather, each death feels like the consequence of your own mistake rather than poor level design.</p>
                    <p>That is mainly due to the fact that the level design in this game is superb. Each level has multiple areas that you can explore, and while the game is mostly linear, there are plenty of hidden passages and rooms to discover throughout. The game is full of variety throughout, with varied level themes, enemy designs, powerups, mechanics, and boss designs, so much so that it really seems like a celebration of the games that came before.</p>
                    <p>However, like the games that came before, it cannot get everything right. It’s a shame that this blemish exists, as it would be easy to fix and seems like a small oversight, but the  in-game menu has a few small issues. There are two of them: the pause menu, which is mapped to the plus button, and the gear and relic menu, which is mapped to the minus button and the X button. The pause menu is wonderful - it is with the gear and relic menu that the issues arise. More often than not, I pressed the X button by mistake while playing the game, causing the menu to open and the flow of the game to stop suddenly. While that can be attributed to fat fingering the button by mistake, it seems odd to map that menu to two different buttons, when the minus button should suffice. Now, this seems like something simple that can be fixed in the controls menu, but there lies another error. If the menu is remapped to just the minus button, that leaves the X button free to be mapped to anything else. However, when remapping buttons in the controls menu, only one button at a time is allowed to be remapped. While the gear menu initially has two buttons, no other function can be mapped to two buttons, so one of your buttons will have no purpose. This could have easily been fixed by allowing the player to map two buttons to one function, so that the player could’ve done something like set the attack to A, special attack to B, and jump to both X and Y. As it stands, this could’ve easily been fixed, but will continue to be a small blemish on the face of a wonderful game.</p>
                    <p>This wonderful game has another flaw that is a bit more important, and that is replayability. While the game is a joy to play through once, the only thing that beating the game achieves is making you feel like you accomplished something. After beating the game, even though there are various difficult achievements that can be earned on the multiple files, there is nothing really to bring the player back to the game once it is complete. The achievements are challenging to acquire, to the point where it can be extremely demoralizing trying to get several of the perfectionist achievements. Due to the lack of post-game content, the game is not often picked up for a second time through.</p>
                    <p>This fault is almost entirely forgotten due to the generosity of Yacht Club Games. Unlike other developers of the time, they strove to create a complete experience for their fans without the greed that is almost standard in the industry. Yacht Club released two new expansions centered around two of the boss characters from the base game: Plague Knight and Spectre Knight, each with their own new spin on the <game>Shovel Knight</game> formula and each of them free if you purchased the <game>Treasure Trove</game> edition of <game>Shovel Knight</game>. Plague Knight makes use of throwing bombs and using magic, and Spectre Knight uses his scythe and increased mobility to zip through the levels. Each one of them feels full of the same love that permeates throughout the base game even though they both feel like complete experiences on their own. And even if that wasn’t enough, there is another expansion for the game coming out later in 2018 that will be based around King Knight that will also be free. It’s really nice to see developers who truly care about their fans, as well as the game they’ve created.</p>
