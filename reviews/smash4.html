                    <p><game>Super Smash Bros. for Wii U</game> is the fourth game in the series that pits classic Nintendo characters against each other in friendly competition and fights to the death. The concept is simple enough, but it is in its execution that this game shines, making the strongest case of any Nintendo game to break down and get a Wii U. However, it definitely has its flaws to match its triumphs, so a deeper look into this game is required.</p>

                    <p><game>Super Smash Bros for Wii U</game> is an excellent example of a great-looking game in an ugly package. While the graphics look great and the style the developers opted for fits well with the characters, the real tragedy is in the menus. The design concept has been carried over from the previous entry in the series, but the designers clearly prioritized form over function. The menus are rather unintuitive and unbalanced, with items like Smash Tour front and center, while settings and single player modes hidden under a vague "Games and More". This and other menu issues (the fact that the Online button on the front page is round while everything else is a jagged mess) hold the game back from being as clean as it could be, as it is graphically a substantial improvement over <game>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</game>.</p>
                    <p>The music is another area that has substantially improved over the previous installment. Each one of the stages has multiple tracks that can be played, with the ability to pick and choose which ones play more often via the music menu. The tracks all represent their series well, and the various remixes show the amount of thought and care that was put in to making the many different styles of music fit into the game.</p>

                    <p>The <game>Smash</game> series has always been extremely solid performance-wise. This game is no exception, sporting an astoundingly solid framerate of 60fps that seems to never drop even in technically demanding sections. This framerate, combined with the series' first foray into HD with a resolution of 1080p, make this game look and play remarkably well. This is made apparent in eight-player battles, where there is so much going on that it's surprising that the game doesn't falter in the slightest.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p><game>Smash</game> has always been about hitting opponents to rack up damage, using that increased damage to launch them off of the stage, and preventing their return to the stage to secure the kill. The game is marginally faster than <game>Brawl</game>, with faster run and fall speeds across the board, helping the game to be more offensive than its predecessor. This, combined with several quality-of-life improvements like the removal of random tripping and chain-grabbing, as well as the addition of ledge-trumping, only serve to improve the gameplay as a whole.</p>
                    <p>Ledge trumping in particular is a great new addition to the mechanics. In previous installments, a player could hold the ledge to force an offstage player to fall to their death, which is not the most exciting way to win the game. Now, if a player grabs the ledge while another is holding it, the player grabs it and forces the other player off, allowing for more offstage play and more interesting exchanges. Recoveries as a whole are stronger thanks to this technique, which allows each stock to last longer than in the previous games.</p>
                    <p>Of course, not all mechanics can be winners, and <game>Smash 4</game> introduces a few losers into the formula. Rage is a mechanic that increases the power of attacks once you reach higher damage percentages. In theory, this would allow players with a lot of damage to make a comeback and defeat the player that's currently ahead. However, rage is not a static increase: it changes based on just how much damage you have taken, meaning that it never really behaves quite how you want or expect it to. Also, the increase in power lends itself to an increase in knockback dealt, meaning that once guaranteed combos or ways of finishing out a stock no longer work and the player is now forced to work harder for the kill.</p>
                    <p>However, perhaps no other mechanic change makes it harder to kill your opponent than the changes made to shielding. Shields are used to prevent damage from attacks and can be foiled by being grabbed. They are also used to dodge attacks with a directional input, which is where the majority of their problems come from. Having the ability to airdodge multiple times in the air is great, as it allows for more mindgames with your opponent. Rolling seems to have been improved as well, allowing you to escape from your opponent if you're in a bad position. Neither of these are bad when taken separately and sparingly, but the way the game works, oftentimes the optimal strategy for winning is to use these moves far too frequently. This style of play leads to more defensive matches, which are both less fun to watch and less fun to play.</p>
                    <p>That said, this is the <game>Smash</game> series; each game is still a ton of fun to play. Fighting against your friends and smashing them around remains just as satisfying as it's always been. The multiplayer is where the game truly shines, sporting up to eight players in a single match whaling on each other with any of 58 characters and numerous items on a variety of stages. The multiplayer never gets old, except maybe when your opponents are computer players that either are combo fodder or can read your mind with little room in between. At that point, you might be thinking that the single player modes would be a good option, and, assuming you could find them in the confusing system of menus, you would be wrong. Classic Mode just feels watered down and the All-Star mode is the same it’s always been: just kind of tacked on. Event mode is by far the most fun of the bunch, offering up a lot of crazy scenarios and themed enemies that you have to fight. The Crazy and Master Orders introduce some interesting ideas, but they are hampered by the fact that their rewards can be duplicates, meaning that it becomes harder and harder to get new trophies/CDs/custom moves the more you play it.</p>
		            <p>Speaking of custom moves, their inclusion was one of the biggest missed opportunities in this game. Each character was given three different options for each of their special moves, allowing for variety in their movesets. However, some of these moves are strictly better than the others and allow characters to have extremely unfair advantages over the rest of the cast (Donkey Kong’s tornado punch/recovery, Kirby’s jumping inhale, Pikachu’s power headbutt, etc.) that were never patched once. The game was patched a total of 17 times, bringing it to version 1.1.7, and custom moves were never once balanced, implying that the developers did not really care about this special addition to the game. Also, no custom moves were ever added to the game after release, which would have been perfectly fine if they had not released seven characters as DLC after the game’s release. These characters don’t have the option for alternate moves, meaning they are avoided when custom moves are activated, which seems like a large oversight. However, the largest oversight is the fact that custom moves have to be unlocked and you can get duplicates of them. Duplicate custom moves don’t give you anything special - they just prevent you from getting a new custom move, and at the rate custom moves are found during the course of the single-player gameplay, they are a chore to collect. Personally, I bought this game the day it came out and I’m still missing at least five of them. In addition, custom fighters can also be powered up with custom equipment, which boosts either attack power, defense, or speed at the expense of one of the others. This is too much customization in this area, as characters now behave completely differently than as if they just got a new move; they are almost a completely different character. This is all fine and good if you and your friends decide not to use them in the spirit of fairness, but if you’re playing the multiplayer and want to practice with custom moves, selecting a random opponent will also randomize their custom equipment, meaning it is near impossible to train for custom move-using fights effectively.</p>
		            <p>Even with all of these flaws, the multiplayer experience is something that cannot be put down. I’m still playing this game almost daily because the gameplay is so damn satisfying.</p>
