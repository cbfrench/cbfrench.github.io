                    <p><game>Sonic Mania</game> is the widely praised return of the blue blur to the forefront of video gaming. Although <game>Sonic Forces</game> came shortly after and impugned his name, Sonic was briefly in the spotlight for the first time in a long time.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>The presentation of this game may honestly be my favorite part. Instead of the 3D graphics they’ve been employing for years that make everything look like a blurry mess, the developers opted for a 2D 16-bit style similar to the original three <game>Sonic</game> games released in the hedgehog’s heyday. The attention to detail is outstanding, and the sprite animations are extremely lifelike and really serve to modernize the game a bit. The original games had similar sprite work, but the new <game>Sonic</game> team working on this game really paid attention to the small details to make this game stand out. There are also 3D sections that are rendered in an older, more polygonal style that really help establish that this game is meant to be a throwback to the good old days.</p>
                    <p>The graphics, while great, pale in comparison to the quality of the music. Every track is just amazing, setting the tone of the stage and feeling so joyous and alive, really imbuing the world the developers have created with life.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>There is not really too much to say performance-wise. The only real issue was that the home button failed to register immediately, meaning the game could not be paused as quickly as intended, but that has since been patched. The game runs smoothly at pretty much all times and the 16-bit art style means the game doesn’t require much power to run the game at 60fps. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <p>The gameplay is where things stop running smoothly. The game is often hailed as one of the most consistent <game>Sonic</game> games ever made. However, when held up to other games, <game>Sonic Mania</game> stumbles in some pretty important areas.</p>
                    <p>The main area that the game stumbles is just how much Sonic stumbles. Sonic was always marketed in the 90s as “the blue blur” who has “gotta go fast,” and <game>Sonic Mania</game> does allow Sonic to go fast at points. However, just when you’re finally going fast, just when you’re finally feeling the rush that the game advertises, just when you’re finally having some fun, the game throws an enemy in your path or some ledge that you cannot see in time and you run into it and come to a stop. It is so frustrating to finally have fun zooming around loops and doing speedy platforming only to get immediately punished for it. I distinctly remember in one of the first few stages I kept closing the game after dying repeatedly in the same spot because the game encouraged speed in the area before it and then put spikes at the end. It is just an irritating design choice that really brings down the level of enjoyment the game provides.</p>
                    <p><game>Sonic</game> also has some other long-standing strange design choices that don’t really make sense in the long run. The ring system is strange, as there is no real reason to collect them. Collecting 100 gets you an extra life, which is useful, but you immediately lose every single one upon being hit, forced to watch them bounce all over the stage. You can collect them all again, but you’ll never collect all 100 of them before they disappear from the screen, and you really only need one at a time. Having one ring provides you the same amount of free damage as 100; the only benefit to having more is that you have the ability to recollect more of them, which means you have the potential to take more hits. However, when combined with the game’s annoying tendency to stop the player in its tracks with an unavoidable enemy, recollecting rings is just anxiety-inducing and tedious when done too many times.</p>
                    <p>What is not tedious and quite possibly may be the most fun part of the game is the 3D sections found in the giant secret rings. They feature a low-poly model of Sonic running around a loop chasing after a balloon with a Chaos Emerald hanging from the bottom. You have the option to collect blue orbs to increase your speed or rings to increase the time remaining. Honestly, this mode blows the rest of the game out of the water: Sonic consistently gets faster, the obstacles are easy to see and easy to remember after several rotations around the track, and the soundtracks for these stages are excellent. Each level gets harder depending on how many of the previous Chaos Emeralds you have collected as well, providing an interesting challenge. There is also another 3D mode that is mildly fun, but chasing the Chaos Emeralds is far more enjoyable.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the boss battles are not really engaging or consistent. Several of them were laughably easy and could be defeated without any thought at all, like the trash compactor boss that involved waiting for about 30 seconds and then jumping several times. Then, there were great ones that felt out of place, like the Mean Bean Machine. And some bosses were just kind of confusing, like how Metal Sonic doesn’t really do anything and just waits for you to spin dash his robots to hit him, or how the final Dr. Eggman fight involved teleporting to fight other, smaller bosses. This, as well as the plot of the game, were supposed to tie in to the next <game>Sonic</game> title, <game>Sonic Forces</game>, but after seeing the backlash against that title, it makes the forced references in the plot and the gameplay feel cheapened in retrospect.</p>

                    <p><game>Sonic Mania</game> has many fans who are all correct about one thing: it may very well be among the best <game>Sonic</game> games ever made. However, when judged against other games, the excellent art and sound design cannot make up for frustrating gameplay that is a core part of the game’s design.</p>
