                    <p><game>Splatoon 2</game> is the second game in the best-selling franchise introduced to Wii U owners back in 2015. <game>Splatoon 2</game> improves upon its predecessor in pretty much every way, even if not by much, to produce a wonderful final product.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>And what a final product it is! <game>Splatoon 2</game> simply oozes style and polish from every model and texture. The ink, especially in single-player mode, is gorgeous, and the aesthetic the designers opted for really makes the game feel as “fresh” as they intended. Every object is just exploding with color and the model designs are really inspired and make the world feel alive.</p>
                    <p>What makes the world of <game>Splatoon 2</game> really come to life is the stellar music choices. Each track is so vibrant and resounding with imagination and life that it is hard to ignore. I oftentimes found myself just leaving the game open at certain parts to listen to the music while I go about my day. They are catchy and get stuck in your head easily even though the lyrics are pure gibberish. Each one is upbeat and thrilling and would make this game worth it even if the gameplay was garbage.</p>

            <div id="performance">
                <div class="row heading">

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <p><game>Splatoon 2</game> is also a wonder to behold, running at 30fps and 1080p in the main hub world. While 60fps is definitely more necessary for this type of game, the hub world has no need for the increased frame rate and the jump to 1080p really makes the plaza area look stunning. Even more stunning is the performance for the gameplay, where the game makes use of adaptive resolution to keep the game around 720p while boosting up the frame rate to a rock-solid 60fps. The game remarkably never drops below this, which is incredibly important for a shooter.</p>
                    <p>However, there is one area that the performance of <game>Splatoon 2</game> suffers: its tick rate. The tick rate is how often the game checks the position of things like the players and the various projectiles and ink in the air. The tick rate checks the positions approximately every 12 frames, which is about one-fifth of a second. While this seems like the blink of an eye, one-fifth of a second is a huge amount of time in a competitive shooter, and it results in deaths that seem unfair and oftentimes both players end up shooting each other at the same time. It really should’ve been improved at this point, but would probably bring down the resolution or frame rate, so it is a necessary evil for the time being.</p>

            <div id="gameplay">
                <div class="row heading">
                    <h2>gameplay</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <p>Other than the tick rate issue, the game plays like a dream. The main focus of <game>Splatoon 2</game> is the multiplayer component, and it feels even more polished this time around. The weapons are all well-designed, with nothing feeling like it is too unfair, and any problems with the weapons continue to be patched out by the development team post-launch. They allow for a variety of play-styles and situations: long or short-range combat, covering the ground or splatting opponents, providing cover fire or kill power, etc. While some weapons feel less fun than others, that can be attributed to the playstyle of the player rather than the inherent design of the weapon, and there are plenty of other weapon types to spare.</p>
                    <p>Also to spare are the various game modes included in this game. The original <game>Splatoon</game> had the basic mode of Turf War, and the ranked modes Tower Control, Splat Zones, and Rainmaker. <game>Splatoon 2</game> includes all of these, along with Clam Blitz and Salmon Run. Clam Blitz is an addition to the ranked modes, and each of them feels like a fleshed out experience that is meant to be secondary to the primary mode of Turf War. Turf War is enjoyable in its simplicity: simply ink the most turf to win the game. The other modes, while enjoyable, are not as stupidly fun as the one that started it all. Turf War continues to bring me back time and time again for some more messy fun, but the Ranked Multiplayer modes seem a bit like an afterthought even though they are fun as well.</p>
                    <p>The new standout mode, however, is Salmon Run. Salmon Run is a mode akin to Zombies modes in Call of Duty games, where a group of four players has to survive against waves of Salmonids to collect their eggs. Each time the game comes online, it provides four different weapons that will be randomly distributed to the group every wave, meaning each player will have to adapt to three different weapon choices if they wish to survive. Eggs are collected by defeating Boss Salmonids, which are larger, more powerful enemies that spawn every once in a while and drop three eggs when killed. On higher difficulties, they spawn more often, and they can be a real challenge to defeat if you do not take care of them quickly. This mode is a blast to play when you’ve got a group of friends together to play it.</p>
                    <p>Of course, if you want to play this game with all of your friends, you’ll all need your own Switch and need to perform some pretty extensive setup. The various mind-boggling choices that were forced upon this game by Nintendo executives are what really hold it back from being incredible. Want to talk to someone in your party during the game? You have to use the Nintendo Switch app and make sure it stays open the entire time, draining your battery extremely quickly. Want to play local co-op with a buddy? You can’t, you’ll need two Switches and other people to play with. Want to play Turf War on a certain map right now? You can’t, they switch out two maps every two hours. Want to play Tower Control right now? You can’t, you can only play Rainmaker in the ranked modes right now. Want to play Salmon Run today? You can’t, the next time it’s available is in three days. This one is the most aggravating, as it is one of the most fun new additions that is restricted simply because the developers did not want the mode to overshadow the main game. Nintendo executives actually have confirmed this in various interviews, and it’s frankly infuriating. The game could have been absolutely incredible, but these choices prevent that from being possible.</p>
                    <p>While the multiplayer has its issues, the single player is relatively issue-free. Though it is true that the original game had a more entertaining final boss, the main campaign of <game>Splatoon 2</game> makes up for it with more interesting concepts and the ability to use a variety of different weapons to replay each level, adding to the replayability of the main campaign. Combined with the single-player Octo Expansion DLC, this game has more than enough to do for those who do not wish to delve into the multiplayer just yet.</p>

                    <p>While the story mode is impressive and the multiplayer is fun overall, there are a few design decisions that really hold <game>Splatoon 2</game> back from being the masterpiece it set out to be. These choices are not necessarily the fault of the designers; rather, the executives behind the scenes included these insane choices. However, even though it is not particularly fair to ding the game for their mistakes, <game>Splatoon 2</game> could have been so much better if it just had more freedom to do what it wanted.</p>
